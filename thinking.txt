- intelligent diffs to reduce time reviewing code ( as LLMs write more code ) 
- minimize visual noise
- eliminate scrolling through a huge codebase / diff by ordering the changes more semantically and logically ( vs naively using the filenames )
- dramatically lower the time to ramp up on an entirely new codebase or track down a bug with little to no prior experience in the codebase. 
- convey only critical information to the engineer
- why now: model inference is getting a lot faster and with recently added max tier subscriptions from big model labs the amortized cost per request is pennies. 
- apply llms to more tedius parts of coding - debugging and PR reviews.
